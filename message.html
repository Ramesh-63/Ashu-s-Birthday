    <p>Dear Ashwini,</p>

    <p>
      Happy birthday 🎁🎂🎈 to the most favorite person of my life 🥺💖 I don't know where to start but I have a lot to
      say to you🌝🤦🏼‍♀ Today is your birthday and it’s the best day for you to relax and enjoy the best things in your
      life 🤗❤️ This day I wanna thank you for being in my life 🧑‍🤝‍🧑💖, thanks for your love 💖 and support
      🧑‍🤝‍🧑, thanks for accepting all my shortcomings 🥺❤️ and always making peace with my dark past 🥺🤦‍♂️.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’ve always waited for this day because I wanted to make you feel special 🤭 and try to make you the happiest.
      You’re the best I have in my life 🎊🎉. More good life to my best friend, the one I can tell my soul to
      🧑‍🤝‍🧑❤️, who can relate to me like no one else 🥰, who I can laugh with without limit. I promise to always
      stick by your side through good and bad...
    </p>

    <p>
      All the times fighting with you and feeling nothing without you 🙆‍♀🥺 – I am glad I have this person with whom I
      can speak my mind without the fear of being judged 😚🤦🏼‍♀. You are one of the reasons behind everything that’s
      happened in my life, mostly 😔. From my tantrums to my madness 😭, to all my happiness 💖💖 and sadness, you have
      always stood there as a rock ✨.
    </p>

    <p>
      You are someone I can blindly count on always till my last breath 🥰💖. I wish nothing but happiness, peace,
      prosperity, and love over your life 🤍.
